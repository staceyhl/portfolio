                “i can be smarter than a cat” is me dipping my toe into Javascript. The assignment was to create a browser-based toy that a user could still interact with, much like a tangible toy. The advantage of this assignment was that the toy didn’t have to be limited by the real world, with its physics and logic. The form allowed us to be more creative and abstract with our ideas.<br><br><br>My inspiration was simple: I want a cat. Specifically, I want a stupid cat. The kind that just lays around all day and would fall trying to jump up to catch a laser point on the wall. So, considering, I can’t get a cat (at the moment), I decided to create a virtual one which I could control through the cursor on the screen. As an extra bit of fun, I chose to turn the cursor into a mouse for the cat to chase after.<br><br><br>In order to create my toy, I decided to break the screen into 16 divs, with each one responding with a new cat image during a hover. This way, I wouldn’t have to go through a grueling process of creating a smooth animation or video of a cat that responded so precisely. In order to accommodate this choppy setup, I leaned into the laziness of the cat; it barely reached into the div the cursor hovered over, so that it was just reaching, not chasing — which would require more movement. Additionally, the simple style and messy coloring of the cat reflected its own stupidity.<br><br><br>Creating this toy gave me the opportunity to try my hand at Javascript for the first time, a new language. It focused on the interaction of the user with the page much more than HTML or CSS did, which forced me to change my way of thinking — not only making me wonder how one would interact with the page, but why?
