                the home page is an immediate overload of buttons screaming "PRESSMEPRESSMEPRESSMEPRESSME." hopefully, the user can find the calm button that reads, "not me."

                the footnote is almost impossible to see, and very eaily missed given the amount of scroll required to find it. its small size is comical in the midst of white space.

                the last screen is a game of tic tac toe. each game is comprised of nine dropdown menus, giving the user the option of X or O. play with a friend, and submit to be greeted once again with a page of buttons.

                The aim of this project was to make us focus on HTML tags. Our assignment was to be creative with the default tags, unencumbered by CSS, that led a user through a series of three pages. It has a large focus on pure code rather than aesthetic and stylistic elements that we may wish to focus on more.<br><br><br>I decided I wanted my pages to have a sense of humor that created a frustrated feeling in the user. For my first page, I utilized the button element, which repeats throughout the page with the label “PRESS ME” — save for one random one, labeled “not me.” Obviously, that button is the only real one out of all the flukes, which will take the user to the next page. That one consists of another fluke button, as well as a footnote that one would need to scroll to see, displaying text that reads “give me an A.” While this is the simplest one, it holds a lot of character and humor. The last page, activated by the footnote hyperlink, presents three rounds of tic-tac-toe. But instead of the usual clean lines of the game, which would require more than just HTML tags, they’re all made of nine dropdown menus that give an option of “X” or “O.” Once they’re all played, users can “submit” their answers, which in reality brings them back to the first page.<br><br><br>This was the most creatively challenging assignment of the semester. While there are many HTML tags, we are always thought to think of it in conjunction with CSS. Stylization is a great tool which has been taken away from us, forcing us to think outside the box and misuse the tags. I had to learn how to make each page appealing and push user interaction without the help of elements like hover states. With aesthetics out of the way, this assignment taught me to consider the user and explore the possibilities of default.
